# Virtual Pictureframe

virtual pictureframe is a simple website that allows users to change the background for the website. Its main intention is to open the site on a tablet and leave it on the table as a picture frame.
It is meant to serve for people who have long distances to their loved ones so the loved ones can still be part of their day to day lives by altering the picture of the frame to something that might happen to their day to day lives.

It works  simply with node.js sockets and detects if user has uploaded a different picture and refreshes the site accordingly.
